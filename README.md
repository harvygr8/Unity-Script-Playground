# UnityScriptPlayground

Collection of Various Unity Scripts in a vanilla lightweight project, Scripts are well categorized and ready to be used in your own project.
To see how the scripts work, I have made several Mini-Games/Scenes to demonstrate the scripts running in-game.

#Script Categories Available:

Camera-Scripts:
  - SimpleCameraFollow

Transform-Scripts:
  - RotateAround
  - RotateAbout
  - PropRotate
  - AutoMove

Basic-Movement:
  -  BallRollMovement

This Project is something that I do whenever I feel like taking a break from my personal projects, but more scripts will be added at least once a week.
I Hope this Script Bank helps you in your GameDev Adventures!
